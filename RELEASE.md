# Sanction Rules

Added to routing rules to provide a more stable and solid connection for websites which applied sanctions and are not blocked by ISP.
You can set a desired DNS and choose preset rules or custom rules for bypassing. This feature makes WorkerLess config a special config which not only can access most of blocked addresses but also can bypass sanctions.

## Import/Export settings

From now on, you can export and import panel settings, this is to make sharing settings with others easier and also is useful when some updates need reseting settings.

> [!WARNING]
> Please export settings and import them after updating to this version to make your panel compatible with this version changes, new deployments do not need to do so.

- Implemented new sing-box DNS regarding 1.12.0 migrations

> [!CAUTION]
> You have to update your sing-box clients to 1.12.x before updating panel to this version.  
> You have to update your Xray clients to the latest, v2rayNG should be at least v1.10.2, v2rayN 7.12.5 and MahsaNG v13.
